# Erdos-Renyi Model

---

## Erdos-Renyi Model â€“ Definition
- Developed in 1959 by Paul ErdÅ‘s and AlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi
- Denoted as G(n, p): n nodes, each pair connected with probability p
- Often used as null models in network science to compare against real networks and detect non-random structure

---

## Erdos-Renyi Model â€“ Manual Python Example
```python
import random
import networkx as nx
G = nx.Graph()
n, p = 100, 0.05
G.add_nodes_from(range(n))
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if random.random() < p:
            G.add_edge(i, j)
```

---

## Erdos-Renyi Model â€“ Using `nx` Function
```python
import networkx as nx
G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=100, p=0.05)
```

---

## Erdos-Renyi Model â€“ Properties
- Binomial (or Poisson-like) degree distribution
- Phase transition: sudden emergence of giant component
- Low clustering

---

### Erdos-Renyi Model â€“ Real-Life Examples
- **Random gene regulatory networks under specific constraints**
- **Neural connectivity in simple organisms (e.g., C. elegans)**
- **Used as null models in biological and social networks**

# Watts-Strogatz Model

---

## Watts-Strogatz Model â€“ Motivation
- Developed in 1998 by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz
- Real-world networks show both high clustering and short path lengths

---

## Watts-Strogatz Model â€“ Manual Python Example
```python
import networkx as nx
import random

# Initialize parameters
n, k, beta = 100, 4, 0.1  # n nodes, k neighbors, beta rewiring probability
G = nx.Graph()

# Create a ring lattice with k neighbors
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(1, k//2 + 1):
        G.add_edge(i, (i + j) % n)
        G.add_edge(i, (i - j) % n)

# Rewire edges with probability beta
edges = list(G.edges())
for i, j in edges:
    if random.random() < beta:
        # Remove the current edge
        G.remove_edge(i, j)

        # Find a valid new target that's not i or already connected to i
        possible_targets = [node for node in range(n) if node != i and not G.has_edge(i, node)]

        # If there are valid targets available
        if possible_targets:
            new_target = random.choice(possible_targets)
            G.add_edge(i, new_target)
        else:
            # If no valid targets, keep the original edge
            G.add_edge(i, j)
```

```python
import networkx as nx
G = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(n=100, k=4, p=0.1)

# Scale-Free Networks

---

## Scale-Free Networks â€“ Definition
- Term popularized in the late 1990s
- Degree distribution follows a power law: P(k) ~ k^-Î³
- Few hubs, many low-degree nodes

# Barabasi-Albert Model

---

## Barabasi-Albert Model â€“ Generation Principle
- Introduced in 1999 by Albert-LÃ¡szlÃ³ BarabÃ¡si and RÃ©ka Albert
- New nodes prefer to attach to high-degree nodes
- "Rich-get-richer" mechanism

---

## Barabasi-Albert Model â€“ Manual Python Example
```python
import networkx as nx
import random
import numpy as np

# Start with a small complete graph
G = nx.complete_graph(2)

# Add nodes one at a time with preferential attachment
while len(G) < 100:
    new_node = len(G)  # ID of the new node
    G.add_node(new_node)
    # Calculate probabilities proportional to node degrees
    degrees = [G.degree(node) for node in G.nodes]
    probabilities = np.array(degrees) / sum(degrees)
    # Select m=2 targets with probability proportional to node degree
    targets = np.random.choice(list(G.nodes), size=2, replace=False, p=probabilities)

    # Add edges from new node to targets
    for target in targets:
        G.add_edge(new_node, target)
```

## Barabasi-Albert Model â€“ Using `nx` Function
```python
import networkx as nx
G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(n=100, m=2)
